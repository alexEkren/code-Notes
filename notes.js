//  I am shit at taking notes 
//DAY 1 AND 3 
// <! -- DOCTYPE just tells the web that hay this file is useing HTML 5 -->

// <!--TAGS THAT I SHOULD KNOW -->
// <b> </b><!-- this is the same as <SRTONGE but we dont realy use b  any more becuse phones had a hard time prosesing it -->
// <i> </i><!-- this is the same as <EM but it had the same problem as b -->
// <em> </em><!--is used to define emphasized text -->
// <!---->
// <hr <!--The <hr> element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page. -->
// <br <!--The <br> tag inserts a single line break.The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems. -->
// <!--anchor tag lets you add links  <a href = ""></a>   -->


// in HTML   we want to have evrything in a tag you can put text that is not in tag
//     but it is preferred not to do that 

// DAY 3 OF LEARING TO CODE  
// FUCK ME AND MY SHITY NOTES i am rewatching the shit i learned to take notes 
// vid 24 out of 408 hoping to finish in 2 weeks 

//why index.html not any other name .. by default most servers just say,
// "I'll return 'index.html'- if I see 'index.html' so index.html is the home page 
//but you can change that 
 
//done rewatching section 4 on to section 5 

//HTML forms 
// day 4 i am moveing sooo slow but i am trying to get my shit life in order 
// finishing up with html 
// The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document
